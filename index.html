                When you purchase a high-end car, you’re investing in more than lightning-fast speediness and shiny hoods (although, those do help). Often, you’re buying a little piece of history. You’re supporting the innovative automotive tech of the future. 

The most expensive cars are more than just price tags; they’re inventions, they’re pedigreed, meticulously-manufactured testaments to their makers, and they’re awe-inspiring inspirations for what we can make, if we really put our minds to it.
